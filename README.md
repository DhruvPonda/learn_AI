Problem Statement

Build an AI-powered solution that helps people learn faster, work smarter, or improve productivity while building, evaluating, or understanding technology-driven decisions.

The Referee – AI Decision Comparison Tool ⚖️🤖

The Referee is an AI-powered decision comparison platform developed for Kiro Week 6 Challenge – “The Referee” under the AI for Bharat initiative.

Most AI tools aim to provide a single “best” answer. However, real-world decisions rarely have one correct choice. Different options come with unique trade-offs, risks, and suitability depending on user priorities.

The Referee addresses this gap by comparing multiple valid options instead of forcing a single recommendation. It clearly explains why one option may be better than another in a given context, enabling users to make confident and well-informed decisions.

Core Problem

Existing AI decision tools often:

Provide only one recommendation

Hide trade-offs and potential risks

Fail to explain reasoning behind choices

For critical decisions such as tech stack selection, career planning, hiring, or major purchases, this lack of transparency can lead to biased or suboptimal outcomes. Users need comparative insights, not one-line answers.

Solution: The Referee

The Referee redefines AI-assisted decision-making by focusing on comparison over prediction.

Instead of answering “What should I choose?”, it helps users understand:

Available options

Pros and cons of each choice

Associated risks and trade-offs

Which option best aligns with their priorities

This approach promotes thoughtful, balanced, and transparent decision-making.

Key Features ✨

Multiple decision domains:

Tech Stack Selection

Career Decisions

Hiring Choices

Major Purchases

Custom Decision Scenarios

Dynamic and context-aware input configuration

Hybrid input sliders (drag, keyboard, manual entry)

Structured comparison cards

Expert-style summary with a clear verdict

Visual trade-off matrix

Robust fallback handling to prevent incomplete analysis

AI Architecture 🧠

The Referee uses a multi-model AI strategy to ensure reliability and availability:

Gemini as the primary reasoning model

Groq as a fallback during rate limits or service unavailability

This guarantees consistent and uninterrupted decision analysis.

Technology Stack 🛠️

Frontend: React, TypeScript (TSX), HTML, CSS, JavaScript

AI Models: Gemini, Groq

Backend: Serverless architecture

Deployment: Cloud-based hosting

The system is modular, scalable, and production-ready.

Role of Kiro ⚡

Kiro significantly accelerated development by enabling rapid iteration, structured experimentation, and fast validation of decision logic—allowing the team to focus on building a refined and high-quality decision experience.

Conclusion

The Referee demonstrates how AI can move beyond single-answer systems to support transparent, trade-off-driven decision-making. By prioritizing comparison and reasoning, it empowers users to make better choices in complex, real-world scenarios.
